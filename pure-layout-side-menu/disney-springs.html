                3. The World of Disney store is essentially what dominated Downtown Disney prior to its rejuvenation. It's the largest store on the property, and although there are so many interesting shopping stores to check out, it's worth getting lost and spending a chunk of time in store that incorporates every Disney element from all four parks in one.
